# Monty-Hall-Problem
A simple and educational simulator for the Monty Hall Problem in Rust.
Feel free to open the code and read the comments.

## What is the Monty Hall problem?
Let's say you're in a game show where you can pick between 3 (or more) doors. Behind one of them there's an amazing prize and behind all the other doors there's a goat (in this hypothetical scenario you don't want to win a goat for some reason). After randomly choosing your door the game show's host opens a different door revealing a goat and gives you the option to pick a different door. Should you? What are the odds of winning if you stick with your first choice? What if you pick a different door? This simulator will answer both of those questions in a simple and educational way.
